      "1. Heat 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil in a large pan over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and carrot, saut√©ing for 3-4 minutes until softened.",
      "2. Stir in the diced chicken and cook for another 2 minutes, just until heated through.",
      "3. Add the cooked rice to the pan, followed by the ketchup and soy sauce. Stir everything together, cooking for another 2-3 minutes until well mixed. Season with salt and pepper to taste.",
      "4. Remove the fried rice from the pan and set it aside. Clean the pan or use a separate one for the eggs.",
